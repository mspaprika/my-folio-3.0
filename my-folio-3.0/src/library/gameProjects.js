        description: `Snake Party üêç originally started as a skills project, but later was upgraded to a Half Time Game during Wednesday Football Matches at Sheffield arena (season '24 -'25). It's also an extension of Snake Pass (released in 2017), which means Noodle got into new endevour alongside new friend Spagett. 

        Main idea of the game is based on OG Snake Game that everyone played in early 2000: eat food and grow the snake. Except here you have a competition aspect - second player and attack/defend mode, when you can steal the food from opponent and make it shrink!  

        Game was built with a great team made of apprentices at Sumo Academy, using in-house C++ framework. Snake movement is controlled by native physics engine.`,
        myCollab: `Particle system and effects: Food orbs, snake grow effect, bees, nature particles and others. The main focus was on the replication of Snake Pass effects as much as possible, to have the same feel and atmosphere. To achieve this I analyzed effects made with blueprints in UE4 and converted them into pure C++.
        
        Particles rendered with DX11 using billboarding. Other techniques include: Perlin Noise for leaves movement; Fresnel for food orbs' colour and opacity.`,

        Main idea: Cat Cafe, but a bit different from what you would imagine. It's a horror game where cat is the main protagonist and is threatened by evil shrooms. Cat needs to find, reclaim and rebuild the Cafe with the help and support of nice mushrooms. 
        
        There are already both types of mushrooms in the game with the basic AI. Main area is confined within a forest, generated using WFC algorithm. It spawns trees, flowers and bushes alongside spider-paths. 
        
        There is no gameplay yet, but I'm working on it. Next steps will include the implementation of a Quest Manager, UI and Day/Night cycle. I started this project as a Blueprint-Only, but later incorporated C++ as well. Final goal - balanced game with both C++ and Blueprints, as both are useful.`,

        Idea came from another game - 'Darkside' by Clockwork Pixels. It's planet-based game with orbital dynamics, where player navigates around the planet and must avoid meteors or shoot missiles to destroy them. 
        
        In as span of 3 weeks I managed to build a simple, but fully playable game with levels, sound controls and power-ups. It doesn't have real UI elements as I ran out of time, so it's simply displaying information in debug text format. 
        
        The coolest thing in my opinion is UFO enemy ship, that is emitting light based on perception of player. If player is invisible, light is white, But if player is detected, it becomes red and UFO goes into attack mode. I used sounds to emphasize this change and randomly activated missiles to add more tension. I also added some cool particle and camera shake effects for juicy juice. `,

        Game is implemented using tile system, which laid foundation for Ghost and Pacman movement. For Ghosts I created a simple AI, where all four ghosts have different chase targets and can be in four different states. Ghost paths are computed by Manhattan Distance only at the moment.

        Pacman also uses little AI for movement, even though it's controlled by a player - this way movement is much smoother.`,

        description: `My second skills project during an internship at Sumo Digital. It uses the level editor for easier design, but needs improvements in resolving collisions.
        
        Main idea - 2D Platformer and I picked my favourite character: a Cat. I was going through some hardship with my own cat and flea infestation at home by the time of creation, and that's where I picked up a flea theme - they're in fact are the biggest enemies of cats. In this game they sense the cat and jumps on it straight away, but unlike in real life the cat can survive just limited amount of fleas. 
        
        Inspiration came from old NES game called Nuts & Milk that I used to play as a child. My main takeway is ladders - a way to climb the platforms, but this feature was hardest to implement and doesn't work perfectly yet. Milk & Nuts also featured a helicopter levels, where this little heli would fly in sinewaves and act as a hazard. I used flies instead, and made them the good guys. If cat catches one, it restores a life! 
        
        Fun Fact: üêà must eat üçè to pass the level; 
                when cat eats üçè it does üí©;
