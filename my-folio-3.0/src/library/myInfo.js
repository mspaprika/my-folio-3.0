    mainInfo: `I’m a junior game developer from Sheffield, currently working as a game programming apprentice while pursuing a Level 7 degree in the field. Over the past few years, I’ve worked on multiple projects—both professional and personal—gaining invaluable experience across all aspects of game development. My primary focus is C++ programming, and every day I strengthen my skills through coding, learning and research.
    
    Before transitioning into game development, I explored various areas of programming through bootcamps and online resources. My journey began with a Level 3 Software Development Bootcamp at Sheffield College, where I learned the fundamentals of software creation—from inception and documentation to management, communication, and testing. My project followed the Waterfall methodology on the Monday.com platform, which was a fascinating experience, even if I may never encounter Waterfall again!

    Next, I enrolled in a Full Stack Development Bootcamp at Developer Academy, which was a turning point in my career. There, I expanded my coding skills and gained real-world experience, working in teams, collaborating on projects, and participating in daily SCRUM meetings. I also delved into web design, security protocols, and database management, all of which laid a strong foundation for my future career in the industry.
    
    Realizing my passion for game development during the web bootcamp, I pursued an internship at Sumo Digital Academy, which led to an apprenticeship—where the real learning began. Working in a AAA game studio provided an unparalleled learning experience, offering daily opportunities to collaborate with professionals across all disciplines, including artists, designers, producers, and publishers. Throughout my apprenticeship, I’ve gained expertise in asset pipelines, rendering techniques and multithreading. But the most exciting aspects of my journey has been contributing to real-world projects. I participated in QA testing for Oil Strike '75 (the teaser game for Still Wakes the Deep) and worked on an unannounced project, actively contributing from its inception well into production. 
    
    The beauty of game development lies in its ever-evolving nature. I thrive on learning new technologies, experimenting with advanced techniques, and pushing the boundaries of what games can achieve. My goal is to keep growing, improving, and contributing to the future of interactive entertainment. I can’t wait to see where this journey takes me next!`,
