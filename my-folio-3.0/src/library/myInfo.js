    mainInfo: "Hey there... /n I am aspiring software developer from Sheffield. My coding journey started more than a year ago and since then I have been intensively learning and building projects. I took part in 2 coding Bootcamps and gained a good amount of skills. I am currently looking for a job as a Junior Developer and continue to learn and build projects. My real passion is problem solving and I solved some cool problems on Leetcode and Codewars. I have been away from this for a while but I plan to come back soon! I specialise both in frontend and backend web development. I am also learning other languages such as Python and C#.",
    projectsInfo: "In last few months I have been working on many projects and I'm excited to share them with you. Most of them were built in very short duration ( tipically 1 week ), so it's rushed work and far away from perfection. First projects are usually those with most mistakes and my mistakes are still here. Even though I put effort into updating them, time is a scarsity now due to intense learning and job hunting. So sorry for non-responsivness and other casualties you might encounter during your adventure in my project land. /n Some projects are not meant to be updated and will stay with me as a memory of how not to do things .",
