    mainInfo: `I'm junior game developer from Sheffield, spending current days as a game programming apprentice and working hard to attain Level 7 degree in the subject. During last couple of years I have been working on several projects, both work and personal, and gained enormous amount of knowldge, skills and experience in all aspects of game development. Huge aspect of my learning is C++ programming and my knowledge in this area is increasing everyday as I code.
    
    Before diving into game dev, I explored oher areas of programming, both through bootcamps and online resources. Firstly, I Completed Level 3 Software Development Bootcamp hosted by Sheffield College. It was short course but tought me all fundamentals of software creation - from inception and documentation to management, communication and testing. My project was implemented using Waterfall methodology on Monday website, and I think it was valuable experience, as I might never ever  meet the Waterfall again!

    Afterwards, I enrolled into a Full Stack Development Bootcamp at Developer Academy, which actually transformed my career. It gave me more knowledge in coding and opportunities to experience a real-life work environment. We worked in teams, collaborated and attended daily SCRUM meetings to discuss achievements, blockers and plans. I learned about web design, security protocols and database management. All this knowledge build solid foundation for my future work in the industry.
    
    Eventually I qualified for internship, hosted by Sumo Digital Academy. I realized I love making games while being on web bootcamp, so it was natural to seek more adventures and learn more. After internship, apprenticeship followed and that's where the real learning started. From coding, design patterns, debugging, profiling and testing to technical leadership and production - all aspects of game development have been covered. I also had daily opportunities to collaborate and learn from professionals of all disciplines, including artists, designers, producers and publishers, just to name a few. Working and learning in AAA Game Studio provided me with such a valuable experience that no courses or even universities ever could. 
    
    I learned about asset pipelines, rendering techniques, multithreading and SIMD operations. In addition to Git, I used Perforce and continuous integration tool TeamCity - including unit and smoke tests. For daily project management and issue tracking, I utilized Azure DevOps and practiced being a Scrum Master several times. The most exciting part was to collaborate in real projects: I took part in QA testing for Oil Strike'75 (Still Wakes The Deep teaser game) and worked on other unanounced project, right from it's inception well into production.`,
