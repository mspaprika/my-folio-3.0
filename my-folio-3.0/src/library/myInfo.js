    mainInfo: `I’m a junior game developer from Sheffield, currently working as a game programming apprentice while pursuing a Level 7 degree in the field. Over the past few years, I’ve worked on multiple projects—both professional and personal—gaining invaluable experience across all aspects of game development. My primary focus is C++ programming, and every day I strengthen my skills through coding, learning and research.
    
    While beauty of game development lies in its ever-evolving nature, I thrive on learning new technologies and experimenting with advanced techniques. My goal is to keep growing, improving, and contributing to the future of interactive entertainment. I can’t wait to see where this journey takes me next!`,
