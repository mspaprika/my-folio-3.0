    mainInfo: `Hey there... I am junior software developer from Sheffield. My coding journey started more than a year ago and since then I have been learning computer science and building projects. I took part in 2 coding Bootcamps where I gained some really cool programming and MERN stack skills. And then it happened - I fell in love with game development! Little by little I'm building my C++ skills and I'm looking forward to start my career in game development.`,
    projectsInfo: "In last few months I have been working on many projects and I'm excited to share them with you. Most of them were built in very short duration ( tipically 1 week ), so it's rushed work and far away from perfection. First projects are usually those with most mistakes and my mistakes are still here. Even though I put effort into updating them, time is a scarsity now due to intense learning and job hunting. So sorry for non-responsivness and other casualties you might encounter during your adventure in my project land. /n Some projects are not meant to be updated and will stay with me as a memory of how not to do things .",
